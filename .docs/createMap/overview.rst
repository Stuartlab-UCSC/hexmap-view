Overview
========

The last two steps in transforming your data into the format the
Tumor Map viewer uses are described in this document.

These are some terms used in this document:

**node** : AKA **ID**, a unique identifer of the things that will be represented by hexagons

**layout** : a map whose node positions are determined by node similarity.

**attribute** : AKA **layer**, a property of a node. Attributes values determine the color of hexagon

Workflow
--------
The diagram below shows the transformation of the data, starting with your data
and ending with the inputs to the Tumor Map viewer.
