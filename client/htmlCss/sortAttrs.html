                <b>Attributes included:</b> Attributes included in the statistics
                and sort are those with Label (yes/no) values. Attributes not
                included are those:
                <ul><li>
                    with a value type of Category or Numeric</li><li>
                    defined by a set (Venn diagram) operation</li><li>
                    defined by selecting samples in a region with the Select tool</li><li>
                    defined by selecting samples with the Import tool
                </li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Focus attribute:</b> Attributes are sorted
                in terms of association with the focus attribute. The list
                contains attributes from the Short List with Label (yes/no)
                values, and not those defined by a set (Venn diagram) operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Sort attributes as Sample-based:</b> The statistics for
                the sort are calculated without taking the map layout into
                account. The chi-Squared test is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Sort attributes as Region-based:</b> The statistics for
                the sort are calculated while taking the map layout into
                account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mutual information statistics are calculated by examining the
                presence of two attributes within regions across the tumor
                map. Region-based statistics will help you find attributes that
                can be mutually exclusive but invoke similar pathways 
                as indicated by the proximity of tumors with these attributes 
                on the map.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Correlation:</b>
                Region-based statistics are calculated only for layers that are
                significantly correlated or anticorrelated with the focus attribute.
            </p>
            <p style='display:none'>
                <b>All Attributes: WARNING:</b>
                Selecting all attributes will result in a single list of sorted attributes 
                that have been ranked with results from statistics tests. Comparisons
                may not be accurate. It is recommended to compare focus attribute to
                different data types one at a time, e.g. using one statistics test.
