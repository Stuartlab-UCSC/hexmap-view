Create a Map Trouble Shooting
=============================

**You are here because your attempt to build a map failed.**

Most of the time this is caused by a mistake in formatting.

First, make sure your input file is in tab separated matrix format.

Specifics on the format for each layout input can be found on the create map
`help page. <https://tumormap.ucsc.edu/help/createMap.html#feature-formats>`_

If none of the common problems below are helpful, please assist the developers by
emailing hexmap@ucsc.edu with the date and time of your failed attempt.
This page will be updated as common problems surface.

Common problems
---------------

	The file selected in "Layout input:" does not match the format specified in the
	"Layout input format:" drop down.

    String identifiers anywhere except first row and first column (unless using
    Sparse Similarity format).
