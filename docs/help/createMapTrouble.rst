Create a Map: Troubleshooting
=============================

**You are here because your attempt to build a map failed.**

Most of the time this is caused by a mistake in formatting.
Specifics on the format for each layout input are at :doc:`createMap`.

If none of the common problems below are helpful, please assist the developers by
emailing hexmap at ucsc dot edu with the date and time of your failed attempt.

This page will be updated as common problems surface.

Common problems
---------------

1. The file is not in TSV (tab-separated value) format.

2. String identifiers anywhere except first row and first column (unless using
Sparse Similarity format). Layout formats are described at :doc:`createMap`.

3. Missing values in your **feature data**. Either correct the values or when in
the **Create Map** window, check **Missing values: Replace with zero**.
