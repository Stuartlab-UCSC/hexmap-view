Attribute Data Types
====================

Each attribute has values that are one of three data types: continuous,
binary, or categorical.

**Continuous** : these values are integers or floating point numbers that contain
a range of numbers. These values are represented with graduated colors from dark
grey to yellow.

**Categorical** : these values have three or more string values. These values are
mapped to colors in the colormap for display.

**Binary** : these values have only two values, either zero and one, or any two string
values. String values are mapped to colors in the colormap, while zeros and ones
use the default colors of dark grey and yellow. An attribute created by
selecting nodes has binary data with values of one and zero.
