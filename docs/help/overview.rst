Overview
========

Tumor Map is a tool that enables grouping samples based on their omic signatures
in a visually accessible way. Similar to dimensionality reduction methods, Tumor
Map method takes a high-dimensional omics space and produces a two dimensional
visualization. Unlike most dimensionality reduction methods, the Tumor Map
method is able to combine multiple types of omics data (e.g. mRNA expression and
methylation data types in a single map). Furthermore, Tumor Map is an
interactive tool that allows navigating through a tumor landscape that
represents a heterogeneous multi-dimensional and multi-platform omic space of
oncogenic signatures.

In the Tumor Map, each node is a sample and clusters of samples indicate groups
with similar oncogenic signatures and genomic alteration events. The samples in
a map may be colored by various molecular, clinical, diagnostic, prognostic, and
phenotypic annotations (e.g. tumor type, molecular subtype, etc.) to visualize
associations with the data type used in clustering.

Terms used throughout the application and this document are:

**node** : the entity represented by a hexagon on the map

**feature** : a property of nodes used to lay out the map

**attribute** : a property of nodes used to color the map
