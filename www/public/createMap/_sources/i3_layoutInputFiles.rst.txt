Layout Input Files
==================

This describes formats of the input files to **layout.py**, the utility that finds
positions for the nodes based on similarity scores.
These files may be generated by utilities earlier in this document.

Three types of data files are required by the layout utility, and one optional file.

Genomic data as a sparse matrix (1)
-----------------------------------

These files contain the genomic data as sparse matrices to perform the
layout calculations.
There may be one or more files with one file per layout and one line per unique
node pair::

 node1  node2   similarity_value
 S1     S2     0.94576
 ...

Node Attributes
---------------

These files contain any types of values that are assigned to nodes.
There may be one or more files with any number of attributes and samples in a
file.
The colors on the map refect the values in these files::

 ID   Subtype   TP63_ mutated   Apoptosis   ...
 S1   1         0               45
 ...

colormaps.tab (1)
-----------------

This file contains the color mappings to categories.
**create_colormaps.py** generates this from the supplied attribute files and
only includes attributes with categorical values.
layout.py copies this to the view directory as *colormaps.tab*.
::

 attribute      index1   category1      color1    index2   category2   color2   ...
 UCEC Subtype   0        Endometrioid   #FF0000   1        Serous      #00FF00   ...
 ...

attribute_tags.tab (1) (optional)
---------------------------------

This file allows you to assign tags to attributes.
These tags are used to limit the number of attributes displayed in the
attribute list.
layout.py copies this to the view directory::

 attribute   tag1       tag2   ...
 Tissue      clinical   phenotype   ...
 ...

Notes:
(1) layout.py needs to be modified to ignore the headers in this file, so
leave out those headers for now.
