Creating an Attribute
---------------------

There are a few ways to create an attribute for additional analysis:

* by `Selecting Nodes <menus.html#selecting-nodes>`_
* from a `Short List <advancedControls.html#short-list>`_ entry described above
* using a `Set Operation <advancedControls.html#set-operations>`_ described above
* from a `Map Reflection <advancedControls.html#map-reflection>`_ described above
