Basic Controls
==============

The controls described here are available on the map layout page so if you are
on the home page, get to the map page with a click on a map thumbnail.

Basic Tumor Map controls include the ability to navigate the map,
color the map and view a node's details.


Navigate the Map
----------------

Zooming and panning are identical to that of a terrestrial Google Map.

To zoom, use the |plus-minus| controls in the lower right of the window,
or the +/- keys on your keyboard.

To pan or move around the map, click on the map and drag it,
or use the left and right arrows on your keyboard.


View attribute values on the Map
--------------------------------

Nodes in the map are colored by attribute values. This allows you to visually explore
the attributes and their relationships to the layout and to each other.

To select an attribute for coloring the map, click on *Select Attributes*
and type in a few letters within the attribute name.
If it exists, it will be displayed along with other attributes matching the string.
Click on the attribute to color the map with those values.
The attribute will appear in the *Short List* at the upper right of the
map
.
The *Select Attributes* drop down contains all the attributes
available for the map, while the *Short List* contains only those attributes
that have already been selected.

More information may be found at `Short List <advancedControls.html#short-list>`_


View a Node's Details
---------------------

In order to view information about the specific nodes in the map, just click on the
node. You may need to zoom in for the nodes to be big enough to click on
the node of interest.
