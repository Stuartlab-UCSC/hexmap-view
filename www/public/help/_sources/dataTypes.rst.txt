Attribute Data Types
====================

Each attribute has values that are one of three data types: continuous,
binary, or categorical.

**Continuous** : these values are integers or floating point numbers that contain
a range of numbers. These values are represented with graduated colors from dark
grey to yellow.

**Categorical** : these values have three or more string values. Each category
is mapped to a unique color for display.

**Binary** : these values have only two values, either zero and one, or any two string
values. String values are mapped to colors in the colormap just like a
categorical attribute, while zeros and ones
use the default colors of dark grey and yellow. An attribute created by
selecting nodes has binary data with values of one and zero.
