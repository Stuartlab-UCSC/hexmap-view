Attribute Data Types
====================

Each attribute has values that are one of three data types: continuous,
binary, or categorical.

**Continuous** values are either floating point numbers or integers that contain
a range of numbers. The values use graduated colors from dark grey to yellow.

**Binary** values have only two values, either zero and one, or any two string
values. String values are mapped to colors in the colormap, while zeros and ones
use the default colors of dark grey and yellow.

**Categorical** values have three or more string values. These values are
mapped to colors in the colormap.
