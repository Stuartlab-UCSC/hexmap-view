Pancan12
--------

The diverse tumor set called “Pan-Cancer-12,” is composed of 12 different
malignancies. It comprises 3,527 cases assayed by at least four of the six
possible data types routinely generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas: whole-exome
DNA sequence (Illumina HiSeq and GAII), DNA copy number variation (Affymetrix
6.0 microarrays), DNA methylation (Illumina 450,000-feature microarrays),
genome-wide mRNA levels (Illumina mRNA-seq), microRNA levels (Illumina
microRNA-seq), and protein levels for 131 proteins and/or phosphorylated
proteins (Reverse Phase Protein Arrays; RPPA).

The Sample Map layouts are composed of tumor samples collected in the study.
Attributes that can be explored on the Sample Map are described at
:ref:`pancan12/samplemapattributes`.

The Gene Map layouts are composed of genes mapping to a probe from the data
collection platforms. E.g. MYC on the mRNA Gene Map, corresponds to the probe
mapping to MYC on the micro array platform. Attributes that can be explored on
the Gene Map are described at
:ref:`pancan12/genemapattributes`.

.. _gliomas:

Gliomas
-------

We assembled a dataset comprising all TCGA newly diagnosed diffuse glioma
consisting of 1,122 patients and comprehensively analyzed using sequencing and
array-based molecular profiling approaches.

We extended our analysis using TumorMap to perform integrated co-clustering
analysis of the combined gene expression (n = 1,196) and DNA methylation (n =
867) profiles. Clusters in the map indicate groups of samples with high
similarity of integrated gene expression and DNA methylation profiles.

.. _quakebrain:

QuakeBrain
----------

We used single cell RNA sequencing on 466 cells to capture the cellular
complexity of the adult and fetal human brain at a whole transcriptome level.
Healthy adult temporal lobe tissue was obtained during surgical procedures where
otherwise normal tissue was removed to gain access to deeper hippocampal
pathology in patients with medical refractory seizures. We were able to classify
individual cells into all of the major neuronal, glial, and vascular cell types
in the brain. We were able to divide neurons into individual communities and
show that these communities preserve the categorization of interneuron subtypes
that is typically observed with the use of classic interneuron markers.

clinical tissue from lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
patients obtained at rapid autopsy.
