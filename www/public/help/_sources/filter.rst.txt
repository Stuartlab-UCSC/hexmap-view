Filter Attributes
=================

Filtering attributes limits the attributes displayed in the long list on the
left, allowing you to more easily find attributes of interest.

**Passing** indicates the number of attributes passing the filters out of the
total number attributes.

**Values** allow you to limit the list to those attributes with values of the
data types checked. More information may be found at :ref:`dataTypes`

**Tags** allow you to limit the list to those attributes with the tags checked.
Not all maps have tags. Note that tags are not mutually exclusive; if an
attribute has more than one tag and any of its tags are checked, that attribute
will appear in the list.

The filter icon will be orange if any filters are affecting the attributes
displayed in the long list on the left.
