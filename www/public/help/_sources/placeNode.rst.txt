Place New Nodes
===============

Place your nodes on the map by clicking on the **Edit** menu
then clicking on **Place New Nodes**.

The resulting window, **Place New Nodes** is described below.

Not all maps have the information required to place new nodes. When you click
on this menu option and the current map does not have the required data, a
message will be displayed indicating the lack of data.

**feature data** : Select a local file to upload that contains the data for
your nodes. The file needs to be in tab-separated-values format as described
in the window.

As soon as a file is selected it is uploaded to compute the nodes' locations
on the map. After the locations are found the nodes will be
dropped on the map. Each new node will be identified with a red marker:
